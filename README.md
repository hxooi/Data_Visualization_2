# Data_Visualization_2

🦄 Data_Visualization_2
Welcome to my Data Visualization 2 project — where raw data meets creative storytelling.


This repository showcases a series of interactive visualizations built using Vega-Lite, HTML, and Pure.css, exploring global startup trends and insights from the Unicorn Companies dataset (2011–2022).


🎯 Project Overview
This project transforms complex startup data into clear, engaging visuals that help audiences understand:
- Which industries dominate the unicorn landscape
- How valuations and company growth evolved across years and regions
- Which countries and investors shaped the global startup ecosystem
  
It’s not just about showing charts — it’s about telling a data story that connects numbers with meaning.


📊 Visualizations
The dashboard includes six sections arranged in a narrative flow:
- 🌍 World Map — Regional and country-level concentration of unicorns
- 🍩 Donut Chart — Overview of unicorn distribution by industry
- 🧬 Alluvial Diagram — Flow of investments across industries and countries
- 🔥 Heatmap — Yearly growth patterns and valuation
- 🍭 Lollipop Chart / Treemap — Highlighting top investors and emerging sectors
- 📈 Stacked Bar Chart — Comparing valuations and counts over time

Each visualization is interactive, color-coded, and designed with a consistent aesthetic for storytelling.


🎨 Design Choices
- Color Palette: Custom 15-color qualitative scheme for industries (AI, FinTech, Health, etc.)
- Typography: Clean layout using Pure.css and Verdana/Arial Black for visual hierarchy
- Annotations: Key moments (like the 2021 unicorn boom) are labeled to guide the viewer
- Layout: Balanced grid-based flow for readability and engagement
- 
🧠 Tools & Technologies
Vega-Lite (v6) for declarative visualization
- Vega-Embed for integration in HTML
- Pure.css for minimalist responsive design
- Custom CSS for typography, spacing, and color harmony
